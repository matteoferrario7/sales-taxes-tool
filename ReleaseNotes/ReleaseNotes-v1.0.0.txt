=========== SALES TAXES TOOL ===========

DESCRIPTION:

Sales taxes tool is an application that generates receipts txt files from shopping baskets txt files.
For each product contained in the shopping baskets txt file, the application calculates:
- basic sales tax: is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt
- import duty tax: is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions
For each shopping baskets txt file, the application generates a receipt containing:
- for each product, the total price (original price + additional taxes)
- the total sales taxes of all products in the shopping basket txt file
- the total price (original price + additional taxes) of all products in the shopping basket txt file
NOTE: the rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains
      (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
